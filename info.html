    <h1>Q1. Difference among var ,let  and const  </h1>
    <p>Var : It can be updated and re-declared into the scope. It can be declared without initialization. It can be accessed without initialization as its default value is “undefined”</p>
    <br>
    <p>Let : It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope. It can be declared without initialization. It cannot be accessed without initialization otherwise it will give ‘referenceError</p>
    <br>
    <p>Const : It cannot be updated or re-declared into the scope. It cannot be declared without initialization . It cannot be accessed without initialization, as it cannot be declared without initialization.</p>


    <h1>Q2. Difference between arrow function and normal function</h1>
    <p>regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword.</p>

    <h1>Q3. Difference map, filter, foreach find </h1>
    <p>The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. If the value is true element remains in the resulting array but if the return value is false the element will be removed for the resulting array. . map() goes through all entries then creates a new array using the function supplied. . find() locates a specific entry by a predicate and returns it. They are both "legitimate" in the sense that these are both things that the methods are supposed to do</p>
    
    <h1>Q4. Why we use templete string</h1>
    <p> Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements</p>
